    * [![Gitter]()]()
    * Internet Search ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is your friend!)
* [Map-based Web Application Examples](./webmap-examples.md)
* [Data Sources](./datasources.md)

## Software
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Supplementary resources
* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) - A
  set of free online books which start from scratch and go, in-depth,
  into javascript concepts and best practices.
* [Mozilla Developer
  Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) -
  Javascript reference materials (highly authoritative)
* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - This is a free
  book with some *advanced* content. As you think about the application
  you might like to build for your final, the chapters on HTML forms, drawing
  with javascript, building a game, and constructing your own painting
  application will push further than we can in class.

## Course outline
Throughout this 15 week course, you'll be learning to program
applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition to programming
skills, we will stress the "tools of the trade": you will use a
text editor designed for programming; your code will be turned in
with git and managed through github. You will be programming in the same
way and with some of the same tools as software developers in the
industry.

We'd like to keep the course somewhat freeform — there are basic skills
which must be touched on, but your interests will help shape the direction
to a large extent. There will be a self-directed final assignment that can
take on any topic you find interesting (so long as you use some tools from
our class).

This syllabus is a living document. As the course progresses, greater detail
will be added to reflect the content of each week.

### Grading scale
| Grade | Score  | Grade | Score | Grade | Score |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A+    | 97–100 | B+    | 87–89 | C+    | 77–79 |
| A     | 93–96  | B     | 83–86 | C     | 73–76 |
| A-    | 90-92  | B-    | 80–82 | C-    | 70–72 |

* Assessment Method / Grading Criteria:
    * Participation, attendance, and homework: 50%
    * Midterm Project: 15%
    * Final Project Proposal: 5%
    * Final Project:  30%

### Weekly repositories
Each week will have a different repository with the seed for that week's
assignment. Turning in an assignment will consist of editing the
template project provided as a part of each week's repo and uploading
your changes to github. Assignments are due (on github) before the next
week's class.

### Midterm project
We will provide a menu of appropriate features for an application to be
programmed midway through the course (in a lab and at home with a
completely open book). This assignment will stress the basics of open-source,
online mapping applications.

### Final project
The final assignment for the class will be decided through a project
proposal. Final projects will be done in groups or independently—
criteria for success will be hammered out in the final project proposal
and group projects (if we have any) will be expected to engage with a wider
scope and greater difficulty than individual projects. Group projects
will also leverage the power of github to make collaboration simpler and
more transparent for grading purposes (this will make more sense once
you're familiar with github).

### Course Schedule

### Academic Integrity
In compliance with Penn's
[Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html),
blatantly and egregiously copying another student's work will
not be tolerated. However, because this course is designed to
help prepare students for work in professional programming
environments, *copying and pasting is not universally prohibited*:
we encourage students to work together and to freely use the
internet as a resource for finding solutions to vexing problems. Citing
every copied and pasted line of code is *not* necessary. Large patterns
or multiple lines of code taken from external sources *should*, however,
be noted with in-code comments. If an instance is unclear, you should
feel free to speak with the instructors.
